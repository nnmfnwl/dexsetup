## DEXSETUP: The Only True-Decentralized-Exchange Setup

### DEXSETUP Take Freedom, Decentralization And Privacy Seriously:
  * **True decentralization**, not like other "fake decentralized exchanges" with many centralized points.
  * Everything **100% transparent and open-source**, not like other "fake decentralized exchanges" with closed components.
  * **100% decentralized liquidity pools**, your funds are 100% of time under your self custody and **automatic DEXBOT trading under your own custom rules**, not like other "fake decentralized exchanges" with centralized liquidity pools, where few people have right to loose your funds or make accidentally a mistake or even restrict someone from trading or even stop whole trading pair.
  * **100% open-source and 100% free** and very easy to join.
  * **100% censorship resistant**, because there is no way to block you from using this system and also nobody could stop this system from single place.
  * **NO limits, NO restrictions, NO registrations, NO cloudflare, NO IP address**.
  * **100% of time self-custody** even whole process of coins exchange called native on-chain atomic swap.
  * **Freedom to choose** to setup from source code on any CPU architecture or binary packages.
  * Every component of setup and runtime is by design **maximum privacy oriented**.
  * Every component of setup and runtime process is by **Firejail-Sandbox isolated**.
  * Every component of setup and runtime process has **networking by Tor-Privacy-Protected**.
  * **Using native official crypto wallets from official sources**.
  * Part of this project is **DEXBOT setup with predefined strategy templates** to easy provide decentralized Liquidity-pools/trading/DCA/BUY/SEL
  * **Xlite lite wallet is 100% open,100% decentralized,100% censorship resistant**
  * **For Debian GNU/Linux** compatible systems
  * **No Root Operating system modifications!**
  * **All from scratch!**, because DEXSETUP is designed as one place to stop and easy setup everything.

### Good To Know About Privacy and Decentralization
  * **Crucial is to have privacy applied on every layer**, accounting, local system files, local metadata, the network. System could have any type of coin swaps, but as long there is public IP, the privacy is zero.
  * **System should be using privacy tools like TOR and native kernel-sandbox to run all apps isolated from your personal data and also protect your privacy on internet**.
  * **Any Crypto exchange that has at least one centralized point is by definition Centralized exchange.**
    * **So all parts of exchange must be decentralized to define itself as Decentralized exchange DEX**.
  * **Bridge is centralized** point that will soon or later fail/outage in critical moments, because of few entities having it under control.
    * Native token/crypto must be used or over-collateralized by something by smart contract.
  * **Centralized liquidity pools** are point that will be soon or later hacked and your liquidity lost.
    * Decentralized independent fragmented liquidity pools(orders) run by any entities are solution.
  * Any Exchange that is using **centralized DNS(Domain name service)** is subject to be censored at any time.
    * Exchange must have an app that is able to reach decentralized network without DNS.
  * Any Exchange that is using **Metamask** is subject to scam you, sell data about you and anyway using **centralized data provider**.
    * Avoid any exchange that has dependency on 3rty software like above mentioned.
  * Any Exchange that does **not allow you to easy use native node** is making you subject to be hacked.
    * There must be ability to verify network by using own nodes or stay connected to trusted decentralized way verified nodes data providers.

### DEXSETUP Features
Crypto currency(cc) wallets, exchanges and bots management could be time consuming task,
so here this project comes:
  * Easy to **prepare fresh installed machine from scratch** or virtual machine for cc GUI wallets or CLI daemons
  * Easy to manage **multiple wallet versions**
  * Easy to manage **multiple blockchain directories**
  * Easy to manage **multiple wallet.dat files**
  * Easy to use **predefined CLI commands** for each wallet instance separately
  * Easy to make and **share custom build configurations** between developers, testers,...
  * Easy to **make custom profiles** by changing few lines of configuration
  * Easy to **setup Blocknet+XBridge+DexBot+trading/liquidity-Strategy**
  * Easy to setup **private, opensource and truly-decetralized liquidity pools** that directly doing atomic-swaps between native wallets like BTC-LTC, DOGE-LTC, XVG, ...
  * Easy to **setup Blocknet's BlockDX truly-decentralized-exchange**
  * Whole build process and wallet security **protection by firejail sandbox**
  * Whole build process and wallet **network privacy protection by TOR**
  * Easy to **test untrusted wallets in secured environment** because build-in system/network protection
  * Every build, script, wallet, cli, daemon is completely isolated from other user-space files, even if it looks like apps are running native way, they are isolated.
  * And little bit more...

### Step By Step Setup Tutorial
  * This tutorial supposed to become one stop point for anyone who want to join us and use unstoppable automatized decentralized exchange trading system.
  * Even if you have minimal knowledge how command line terminal works, it is just about copy pasting commands by your own requirements and setup do all hard stuff for you. This tutorial also teach you everything you need to know practically.
