### The only True-Decentralized-Exchange Setup
  * All parts by Firejail-Sandbox securely isolated even from each other
  * Whole setup and runtime by Tor-Privacy-Protected
  * Ability of decentralized Liquidity-pools/trading/DCA/BUY/SEL
  * For Debian GNU/Linux compatible systems
  * All also even from scratch!

### Motivation
  * Any Crypto exchange that has at least one centralized point is by definition Centralized exchange.
    * So all parts of exchange must be decentralized to define itself as DEX.
  * Bridge is centralized point that will soon or later fail/outage in critical moments, because of few entities having it under control.
    * Native token/crypto must be used or over-collateralized by something by smart contract.
  * Centralized liquidity pools are point that will be soon or later hacked and your liquidity lost.
    * Decentralized independent fragmented liquidity pools(orders) run by any entities are solution.
  * Any Exchange that is using DNS(Domain name service) is subject to be censored at any time.
    * Exchange must have an app that is able to reach decentralized network without DNS.
  * Any Exchange that is using Metamask is subject to scam you, sell data about you and anyway using centralized data provider.
    * Avoid any exchange that has dependency on 3rty software like above mentioned.
  * Any Exchange that does not allow you to use native node is making you subject to be hacked.
    * There must be ability to verify network by using own nodes or stay connected to trusted decentralized way verified nodes data providers.

### About
Crypto currency(cc) wallets, exchanges and bots management could be time consuming task,
so here this project comes:
  * Easy to **prepare fresh installed machine from scratch** or virtual machine for cc GUI wallets or CLI daemons
  * Easy to manage **multiple wallet versions**
  * Easy to manage **multiple blockchain directories**
  * Easy to manage **multiple wallet.dat files**
  * Easy to use **predefined CLI commands** for each wallet instance separately
  * Easy to make and **share custom build configurations** between developers, testers,...
  * Easy to **make custom profiles** by changing few lines of configuration
  * Easy to **setup Blocknet+XBridge+DexBot+trading/liquidity-Strategy**
  * Easy to setup **private, opensource and truly-decetralized liquidity pools** that directly doing atomic-swaps between native wallets like BTC-LTC, DOGE-LTC, XVG, ...
  * Easy to **setup Blocknet's BlockDX truly-decentralized-exchange**
  * Whole build process and wallet security **protection by firejail sandbox**
  * Whole build process and wallet **network privacy protection by TOR**
  * Easy to **test untrusted wallets in secured environment** because build-in system/network protection
  * Every build, script, wallet, cli, daemon is completely isolated from other user-space files, even if it looks like apps are running native way, they are isolated.
  * And little bit more...
